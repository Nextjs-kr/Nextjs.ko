description: Next.js allows you to serve static files, like images, in the public directory. You can learn how it works here.

Next.js can serve static files, like images, under a folder called `public` in the root directory. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

For example, if you add `me.png` inside `public`, the following code will access the image:

```jsx filename="Avatar.js"
import Image from "next/image";

export function Avatar() {
	return <Image src="/me.png" alt="me" width="64" height="64" />;
}
```

For static metadata files, such as `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico`, etc, you should use [special metadata files](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata) inside the `app` folder.

> Good to know:
>
> -   The directory must be named `public`. The name cannot be changed and it's the only directory used to serve static assets.
> -   Only assets that are in the `public` directory at [build time](/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#build) will be served by Next.js. Files added at request time won't be available. We recommend using a third-party service like [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for persistent file storage.
