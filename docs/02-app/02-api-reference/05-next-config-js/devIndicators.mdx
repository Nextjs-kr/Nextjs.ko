description: Optimized pages include an indicator to let you know if it's being statically optimized. You can opt-out of it here.

{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the  component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

When you edit your code, and Next.js is compiling the application, a compilation indicator appears in the bottom right corner of the page.

> **Good to know**: This indicator is only present in development mode and will not appear when building and running the app in production mode.

In some cases this indicator can be misplaced on your page, for example, when conflicting with a chat launcher. To change its position, open `next.config.js` and set the `buildActivityPosition` in the `devIndicators` object to `bottom-right` (default), `bottom-left`, `top-right` or `top-left`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
	devIndicators: {
		buildActivityPosition: "bottom-right",
	},
};
```

In some cases this indicator might not be useful for you. To remove it, open `next.config.js` and disable the `buildActivity` config in `devIndicators` object:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
	devIndicators: {
		buildActivity: false,
	},
};
```
